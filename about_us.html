            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>How does wireless charging work for electric vehicles?</h4>
                <p>Wireless charging for electric vehicles utilizes electromagnetic fields to transfer energy between a charging pad on the ground and a receiver on the vehicle. When the vehicle is parked over the charging pad, the electromagnetic field induces an electric current in the receiver, which then charges the vehicle's battery.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Is wireless charging as efficient as traditional wired charging?</h4>
                <p>Yes, wireless charging can be just as efficient as traditional wired charging, with some systems achieving efficiencies comparable to or even exceeding wired charging. However, efficiency can vary depending on factors such as the distance between the charging pad and the receiver, as well as the alignment of the two components.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
